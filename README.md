# Traffic Prediction

Our team's final project, titled 'IoT_Project_Final.ipynb', showcases an innovative approach to traffic analysis and prediction. Leveraging a comprehensive traffic dataset, we employed advanced deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models, to accurately forecast vehicle counts at various junctions over time. This predictive capability empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding traffic management and resource allocation.

Furthermore, we explored the potential of neural network methodologies beyond traffic prediction. By harnessing the rich features within the dataset, we embarked on an exciting exploration to determine if the characteristics of the junction itself could be predicted. Through extensive experimentation with diverse neural network architectures, we successfully identified patterns and relationships within the data that enable us to predict the location of a given junction.

Our project not only contributes to the field of intelligent transportation systems but also provides valuable insights for urban planning, infrastructure optimization, and traffic flow management. By harnessing the power of IoT and cutting-edge machine learning techniques, we have demonstrated the potential for data-driven decision-making and enhanced efficiency in transportation networks.
